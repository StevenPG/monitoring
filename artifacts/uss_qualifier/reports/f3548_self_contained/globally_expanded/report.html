<h4>Clear area validation test step</h4>
<p>uss_qualifier verifies with the DSS that there are no operational intents remaining in the area.</p>
<h5>🛑 DSS responses check</h5>
<p>If the DSS fails to reply to a query concerning operational intent references in a given area, or fails to allow the deletion of
an operational intent from its own creator, it is in violation of <strong><a href="https://github.com/interuss/monitoring/blob/46ab3ae9c3a91e411d4b3fb5835e269491f0a0ed/monitoring/uss_qualifier/requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md">astm.f3548.v21.DSS0005,1</a></strong>

<h5>🛑 Area is clear of op intents check</h5>
<p>If operational intents exist in the 4D area(s) that should be clear, then the current state of the test environment is not suitable to conduct tests so this check will fail.</p>
<p>This step examines whether any operational intents remain.  If any foreign (other than uss_qualifier-owned) operational intents remain, then this step's checks will fail.  If any uss_qualifier-owned operational intents remain, the checks for this step do not fail but instead we proceed to the next test case.  If the area is clear, we skip the next test case.</p>

<h2>[8] ASTM F3548-21 UTM DSS Operational Intent Reference State Transitions</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>This scenario ensures that a DSS will only let the owner of an operational intent reference modify it.</p>
<h3>Resources</h3>
<h4>flight_intents</h4>
<p>A <code>resources.flight_planning.FlightIntentsResource</code> containing the flight intents to be used in this scenario:</p>
<p>This scenario expects to find at least one flight intent in this resource. It will use its extents to create and mutate an operational intent reference,
but ignore any specified states, as this scenario will iterate over all allowed states.</p>
<p>Provided by non_conflicting_flights in top-level resource pool.</p>
<h4>dss</h4>
<p>A <code>resources.astm.f3548.v21.DSSInstanceResource</code> pointing to the DSS instance to test for this scenario.</p>
<p>Provided by instance 1 in dss_instances in top-level resource pool.</p>
<h4>id_generator</h4>
<p>A <code>resources.interuss.IDGeneratorResource</code> that will be used to generate the IDs of the operational intent references created in this scenario.</p>
<p>Provided by id_generator in top-level resource pool.</p>
<h3>Setup test case</h3>
<p>Makes sure that the DSS is in a clean and expected state before running the test, and that the passed resources work as required.</p>

<p>Note that to benefit from the maximum coverage, the DSS' AuthAdapterResource must be able to obtain credentials
for multiple scopes (so that a wrong scope may be used in place of the correct one) as well as an empty scope
(that is, provide credentials where the scope is an empty string).</p>
<p>This scenario will check for the scope's availability and transparently ignore checks that can't be conducted.</p>
<p>At least one of the following scopes needs to be available for this scenario to at least partially run:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>utm.strategic_coordination</code></li>
<li><code>utm.availability_arbitration</code></li>
<li><code>utm.constraint_management</code></li>
</ul>
<p>In order to verify each endpoint group, all scopes above must be available.</p>

<h2>[16] ASTM F3548-21 UTM DSS Operational Intent Reference Access Control</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>This scenario ensures that a DSS will only let the owner of an operational intent reference modify it.</p>
<h3>Resources</h3>
<h4>flight_intents</h4>
<p>A <code>resources.flight_planning.FlightIntentsResource</code> containing the flight intents to be used in this scenario:</p>
<p>This scenario expects to find at least two separate flight intents in this resource, as it will use their extent
to create two operational intents references.</p>
<p>Provided by non_conflicting_flights in top-level resource pool.</p>
<h4>dss</h4>
<p>A <code>resources.astm.f3548.v21.DSSInstanceResource</code> pointing to the DSS instance to test for this scenario.</p>
<p>Provided by instance 1 in dss_instances in top-level resource pool.</p>
<h4>second_utm_auth</h4>
<p>A <code>resources.communications.AuthAdapterResource</code> containing a second set of valid credentials for interacting with the DSS.</p>
<p>This second set of credentials is required to validate that the DSS is properly enforcing access control rules, and properly limits the actions of a client against
the resources exposed by the DSS.</p>
<p>The participant under test is responsible for providing this second set of credentials along the primary ones used in most other scenarios.</p>
<h5>Credential requirements</h5>
<p>In general, these test credentials may be in all points equal to the ones used by the <code>AuthAdapterResource</code> that is
provided to the <code>dss</code> resources above, except for the value contained in the <code>sub</code> claim of the token.</p>
<p>For the purpose of this scenario, these credentials must be allowed to create, modify and delete operational intents on the DSS,
as well as querying operational intent references.</p>
<h6>Required scope</h6>
<p>For the purpose of this scenario, the <code>second_utm_auth</code> resource must provide access to a token with at least the following scope:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>utm.strategic_coordination</code></li>
</ul>
<h6>Separate subscription</h6>
<p>Note that the subscription (or 'sub' claim) of the token that will be obtained for this resource
MUST be different from the one of the <code>dss</code> resources mentioned above:
this will be verified at runtime, and this scenario will fail if the second set of credentials belong to the same subscription as the main one.</p>
<p>Provided by second_utm_auth in top-level resource pool.</p>
<h4>id_generator</h4>
<p>A <code>resources.interuss.IDGeneratorResource</code> that will be used to generate the IDs of the operational intent references created in this scenario.</p>
<p>Provided by id_generator in top-level resource pool.</p>
<h3>Setup test case</h3>
<p>Makes sure that the DSS is in a clean and expected state before running the test, and that the passed resources work as required.</p>
<p>The setup will create two separate operational intent references: one for each set of the available credentials.</p>

<p>For the setup of this test case, the scenario ensures that the availability for the USS specified in the <code>client_identity</code> resource
is <code>Unknown</code>, which is the default expected state when nothing else is known.</p>
<h4>Ensure test USS has Unknown availability test step</h4>
<p>This step ensures that the scenario starts from a state where the USS availability is <code>Unknown</code>.</p>

<h2>[25] ASTM F3548-21 UTM DSS Operational Intent Reference State Transitions</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>This scenario ensures that a DSS will only let the owner of an operational intent reference modify it.</p>
<h3>Resources</h3>
<h4>flight_intents</h4>
<p>A <code>resources.flight_planning.FlightIntentsResource</code> containing the flight intents to be used in this scenario:</p>
<p>This scenario expects to find at least one flight intent in this resource. It will use its extents to create and mutate an operational intent reference,
but ignore any specified states, as this scenario will iterate over all allowed states.</p>
<p>Provided by non_conflicting_flights in top-level resource pool.</p>
<h4>dss</h4>
<p>A <code>resources.astm.f3548.v21.DSSInstanceResource</code> pointing to the DSS instance to test for this scenario.</p>
<p>Provided by instance 2 in dss_instances in top-level resource pool.</p>
<h4>id_generator</h4>
<p>A <code>resources.interuss.IDGeneratorResource</code> that will be used to generate the IDs of the operational intent references created in this scenario.</p>
<p>Provided by id_generator in top-level resource pool.</p>
<h3>Setup test case</h3>
<p>Makes sure that the DSS is in a clean and expected state before running the test, and that the passed resources work as required.</p>

<h3>Key validation on creation test case</h3>
<p>This test case will create multiple operational intent references and verify that the <code>key</code> field
of the parameters to create or update an operational intent reference is properly validated.</p>
<p>That is: the DSS should require that the client provides the OVNs for each entity that is in the vicinity,
both geographically and temporally, of the client's operational intent reference.</p>

<p>This page describes the content of a common test step that ensures a clean workspace for testing interactions with a DSS</p>
<h5>🛑 Operational intent references can be queried by ID check</h5>
<p>If an existing operational intent reference cannot directly be queried by its ID, or if for a non-existing one the DSS replies with a status code different than 404,
the DSS implementation is in violation of <strong><a href="https://github.com/interuss/monitoring/blob/46ab3ae9c3a91e411d4b3fb5835e269491f0a0ed/monitoring/uss_qualifier/requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md">astm.f3548.v21.DSS0005,1</a></strong>.</p>

<h6>🛑USS Availability can be updated check</h6>
<p>If, when presented with a valid query to update the availability state of a USS, a DSS
responds with anything else than a 200 OK response, it is in violation of the OpenAPI specification referenced by <strong><a href="https://github.com/interuss/monitoring/blob/46ab3ae9c3a91e411d4b3fb5835e269491f0a0ed/monitoring/uss_qualifier/requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md">astm.f3548.v21.DSS0100,1</a></strong>.</p>
<h3>Endpoint authorization test case</h3>

<h2>[33] ASTM F3548-21 UTM DSS Operational Intent Reference Access Control</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>This scenario ensures that a DSS will only let the owner of an operational intent reference modify it.</p>
<h3>Resources</h3>
<h4>flight_intents</h4>
<p>A <code>resources.flight_planning.FlightIntentsResource</code> containing the flight intents to be used in this scenario:</p>
<p>This scenario expects to find at least two separate flight intents in this resource, as it will use their extent
to create two operational intents references.</p>
<p>Provided by non_conflicting_flights in top-level resource pool.</p>
<h4>dss</h4>
<p>A <code>resources.astm.f3548.v21.DSSInstanceResource</code> pointing to the DSS instance to test for this scenario.</p>
<p>Provided by instance 2 in dss_instances in top-level resource pool.</p>
<h4>second_utm_auth</h4>
<p>A <code>resources.communications.AuthAdapterResource</code> containing a second set of valid credentials for interacting with the DSS.</p>
<p>This second set of credentials is required to validate that the DSS is properly enforcing access control rules, and properly limits the actions of a client against
the resources exposed by the DSS.</p>
<p>The participant under test is responsible for providing this second set of credentials along the primary ones used in most other scenarios.</p>
<h5>Credential requirements</h5>
<p>In general, these test credentials may be in all points equal to the ones used by the <code>AuthAdapterResource</code> that is
provided to the <code>dss</code> resources above, except for the value contained in the <code>sub</code> claim of the token.</p>
<p>For the purpose of this scenario, these credentials must be allowed to create, modify and delete operational intents on the DSS,
as well as querying operational intent references.</p>
<h6>Required scope</h6>
<p>For the purpose of this scenario, the <code>second_utm_auth</code> resource must provide access to a token with at least the following scope:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>utm.strategic_coordination</code></li>
</ul>
<h6>Separate subscription</h6>
<p>Note that the subscription (or 'sub' claim) of the token that will be obtained for this resource
MUST be different from the one of the <code>dss</code> resources mentioned above:
this will be verified at runtime, and this scenario will fail if the second set of credentials belong to the same subscription as the main one.</p>
<p>Provided by second_utm_auth in top-level resource pool.</p>
<h4>id_generator</h4>
<p>A <code>resources.interuss.IDGeneratorResource</code> that will be used to generate the IDs of the operational intent references created in this scenario.</p>
<p>Provided by id_generator in top-level resource pool.</p>
<h3>Setup test case</h3>
<p>Makes sure that the DSS is in a clean and expected state before running the test, and that the passed resources work as required.</p>
<p>The setup will create two separate operational intent references: one for each set of the available credentials.</p>
<h4>Ensure clean workspace test step</h4>

<h4>second_utm_auth</h4>
<p>A <code>resources.communications.AuthAdapterResource</code> containing a second set of valid credentials for interacting with the DSS.</p>
<p>This second set of credentials is required to validate that the DSS properly synchronizes the manager of a subscription to other DSS instances.</p>
<p>The test designer should provide this second set of credentials when full testing of manager synchronization behavior is desired.</p>
<h5>Credential requirements</h5>
<p>In general, these test credentials may be in all points equal to the ones used by the <code>AuthAdapterResource</code> that is
provided to the <code>dss</code> resources above, except for the value contained in the <code>sub</code> claim of the token.</p>
<p>Note that most checks in this scenario will work if the second set of credentials is not provided.</p>
<h6>Required scope</h6>
<p>For the purpose of this scenario, the <code>second_utm_auth</code> resource must provide access to a token with at least the following scope:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>utm.strategic_coordination</code></li>
</ul>
<h6>Separate subject</h6>
<p>Note that the subject (or 'sub' claim) of the token that will be obtained for this resource
MUST be different from the one of the <code>dss</code> resources mentioned above:
this will be verified at runtime, and the depending checks will not be run if this is not the case.</p>

<p>This page describes the content of a common test step where a user flight intent should be denied modification because
of a non-permitted conflict with an equal priority flight intent.
See <code>modify_activated_conflict_flight</code> in <a href="https://github.com/interuss/monitoring/blob/46ab3ae9c3a91e411d4b3fb5835e269491f0a0ed/monitoring/uss_qualifier/scenarios/flight_planning/prioritization_test_steps.py">prioritization_test_steps.py</a>.</p>
<h6>🛑 Incorrectly modified check</h6>
<p>If the USS successfully modifies the flight or otherwise fails to indicate a conflict, it means they failed to detect
the conflict with the pre-existing flight.
Therefore, this check will fail if the USS indicates success in modifying the flight from the user flight intent,
per <strong><a href="https://github.com/interuss/monitoring/blob/46ab3ae9c3a91e411d4b3fb5835e269491f0a0ed/monitoring/uss_qualifier/requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md">astm.f3548.v21.SCD0050</a></strong>.</p>

The test driver attempts to enlarge Flight 1c so that it conflicts with Flight 2.
Both flights are activated at the point where that change is requested. However, because the conflict did not
exist when the modification was initiated, it should be rejected per <strong><a href="https://github.com/interuss/monitoring/blob/46ab3ae9c3a91e411d4b3fb5835e269491f0a0ed/monitoring/uss_qualifier/requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md">astm.f3548.v21.SCD0050</a></strong>.</p>

execution will stop without failing.</p>

<h2>[42] Nominal planning: not permitted conflict with equal priority</h2>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>This test aims at testing the strategic coordination requirements that relate to the prioritization scenarios where
there exists a conflict with an equal priority flight that is not permitted by regulation:</p>

<p>It involves a tested USS and a control USS through which conflicting flights are injected.</p>
<p>This scenario skips execution and completes successfully at the setup case if a resource containing equal priority flight intents where conflicts are not allow is not provided, such as if a jurisdiction does not have any priority levels at which conflicts are not allowed.</p>
<p>It assumes that the area used in the scenario is already clear of any pre-existing flights (using, for instance, PrepareFlightPlanners scenario).</p>
<h3>Resources</h3>
<h4>flight_intents</h4>
<p>If the jurisdiction in which these tests are being conducted does not have a priority level at which conflicts are not allowed, the FlightIntentsResource must be None to prevent the
execution of this test.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the FlightIntentsResource must provide the following flight intents:</p>

<p>Because the scenario involves activation of intents, the start times of all activated intents must be during the time
the test scenario is executed (not before). Additionally, their end times must leave sufficient time for the execution
of the test scenario.</p>

<h4>control_uss</h4>
<p>FlightPlannerResource that will be used to inject conflicting Flight 2. Note that this control USS needs to support the
CMSA role in order to transition to the <code>Nonconforming</code> state in order to create a pre-existing conflict among equal-priority operational intents.</p>
<p>Provided by instance 2 in flight_planners in top-level resource pool.</p>

<h3>Prerequisites check test case</h3>
<h4>Verify area is clear test step</h4>
<p>uss_qualifier verifies with the DSS that there are no operational intents remaining in the area.</p>
<h5>🛑 DSS responses check</h5>
<p>If the DSS fails to reply to a query concerning operational intent references in a given area, or fails to allow the deletion of
an operational intent from its own creator, it is in violation of <strong><a href="https://github.com/interuss/monitoring/blob/46ab3ae9c3a91e411d4b3fb5835e269491f0a0ed/monitoring/uss_qualifier/requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md">astm.f3548.v21.DSS0005,1</a></strong>

<p>✅ uss1_dss (2024-11-19T09:55:32.360975Z)</p>
<h5>🛑 Area is clear of op intents check</h5>
<p>If operational intents exist in the 4D area(s) that should be clear, then the current state of the test environment is not suitable to conduct tests so this check will fail.</p>
<p>While this scenario assumes that the area used is already clear of any pre-existing flights (using, for instance, PrepareFlightPlanners scenario) in order to avoid a large number of area-clearing operations, the scenario will not proceed correctly if the area was left in a dirty state following a previous scenario that was supposed to leave the area clear.  This test step verifies that the area is clear.</p>

<h2>[44] Nominal planning: not permitted conflict with equal priority</h2>

<p>It involves a tested USS and a control USS through which conflicting flights are injected.</p>
<p>This scenario skips execution and completes successfully at the setup case if a resource containing equal priority flight intents where conflicts are not allow is not provided, such as if a jurisdiction does not have any priority levels at which conflicts are not allowed.</p>
<p>It assumes that the area used in the scenario is already clear of any pre-existing flights (using, for instance, PrepareFlightPlanners scenario).</p>

<h5>🛑 Area is clear of op intents check</h5>
<p>If operational intents exist in the 4D area(s) that should be clear, then the current state of the test environment is not suitable to conduct tests so this check will fail.</p>
<p>While this scenario assumes that the area used is already clear of any pre-existing flights (using, for instance, PrepareFlightPlanners scenario) in order to avoid a large number of area-clearing operations, the scenario will not proceed correctly if the area was left in a dirty state following a previous scenario that was supposed to leave the area clear.  This test step verifies that the area is clear.</p>

<h4>Declare Flight 2 non-conforming test step</h4>
<p>The test driver instructs the control USS to declare Flight 2 as non-conforming. This makes non-conforming Flight 2 conflict with activated Flight 1 -- this same-priority conflict would not be allowed if Flight 2 were in a nominal state.</p>
<p>Do note that executing this test step requires the control USS to support the CMSA role. As such, if the USS rejects the
transition to non-conforming state, it will be assumed that the control USS does not support this role and the test
execution will stop without failing.</p>

<h2>[45] Data Validation of GET operational intents by USS</h2>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>This test checks that the USS being tested validates the operational intents received as response to its GET request from another USS.
mock_uss plans an operation designed to be relevant to (but not intersect) the operation tested_uss will plan, and provides the data that tested_uss GETs.
tested_uss validates the GET response from mock_uss and accordingly plan its operation.</p>
<p>The primary requirement tested by this scenario is <strong><a href="https://github.com/interuss/monitoring/blob/46ab3ae9c3a91e411d4b3fb5835e269491f0a0ed/monitoring/uss_qualifier/requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md">astm.f3548.v21.SCD0035</a></strong> because a USS cannot verify its operational intent does not conflict when it cannot obtain valid details for that operational intent.</p>
<p>This scenario assumes that the area used in the scenario is already clear of any pre-existing flights (using, for instance, PrepareFlightPlanners scenario).</p>
<h3>Resources</h3>
<h4>flight_intents</h4>
<p>FlightIntentsResource provides the two flight intents which must be relevant to each other, but must not intersect.
This can generally be accomplished when the convex hulls of the 2D footprints of the two flights intersect, but the polygons do not intersect.
There is an overlap in time and altitude of the two flights.</p>
<ul>
<li>flight_1</li>
<li>flight_2</li>
</ul>
<p>Provided by non_conflicting_flights in top-level resource pool.</p>
<h4>mock_uss</h4>
<p>MockUSSResource that will be used for planning flights, controlling data shared for validation testing, and gathering interuss interactions from mock_uss.</p>
<p>Provided by mock_uss in top-level resource pool.</p>
<h4>tested_uss</h4>
<p>FlightPlannerResource that will be used for the USS being tested for its data validation of operational intent.</p>
<p>Provided by instance 1 in flight_planners in top-level resource pool.</p>

USS about its operational intent to the subscribing USS in no more than MaxRespondToSubscriptionNotification (5) seconds,
95 percent of the time.
To verify that notification was indeed sent for this check, waiting up to MaxRespondToSubscriptionNotificationSeconds gets us
95 percent confidence in declaring the USS non-compliant if notification is not received.
To ensure the notifications sent are not missed for a test case, we can pick a threshold that gives
a very high (e.g., 99 percent per test) confidence of non-compliance. We can make conservative assumptions
about the distribution of the delays. If we assume that the notification delays have a normal distribution
with 95 percentile at 5 seconds, then with the standard deviation of 3.04, we get the 99 percentile at 7.07 seconds.
Hence, for test cases that check notification sent for an operational intent, we will wait for notifications till threshold

<h6>Note</h6>
<p>As per <strong><a href="https://github.com/interuss/monitoring/blob/46ab3ae9c3a91e411d4b3fb5835e269491f0a0ed/monitoring/uss_qualifier/requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md">astm.f3548.v21.SCD0085</a></strong>, MaxRespondToSubscriptionNotification
is measured from time_start - Receipt of subscription notification from DSS -
till time_end - Entity details sent to subscribing USS.
To make sure the test driver gives enough time for notifications to be received by mock_uss,
it marks the time to get interactions from mock_uss as - the time test driver initiates the plan.
The sequence of events is -</p>
<ol>
<li>Test driver initiates plan to tested_uss. t0</li>
<li>tested_uss shares the plan with DSS and receives DSS response. t_time_start.</li>
<li>tested_uss responds to test driver with Completed.</li>
<li>Test driver checks for shared operational_intent in DSS and checks its retrievable. t1</li>
<li>Test driver waits for MaxTimeToWaitForSubscriptionNotificationSeconds.</li>
<li>Test driver retrieves interactions from mock_uss. t1 + MaxTimeToWaitForSubscriptionNotificationSeconds</li>
<li>Test driver should find the notification in these interactions to declare that USS sent notifications.</li>
</ol>
<p>We know from above that waiting from t_time_start for MaxTimeToWaitForSubscriptionNotificationSeconds would
give us 99% confidence that we receive the notifications. But, test_driver doesn't have access to t_time_start.
So, it starts waiting from a point of time after the t_time_start that is t1.
This ensures that test driver waits for a long enough duration before getting the interactions. Hence, we get
a high confidence that the test driver correctly verifies if a notification was sent by tested_uss.</p>

<h5>Plan unsuccessfully</h5>
<p>This page describes the content of a common test case where a valid user flight intent fails in a flight planner, because of invalid data shared for a nearby flight shared by another USS.  See <code>plan_flight_intent_expect_failed</code> in invalid_op_test_steps.py.</p>
<h6>🛑 Plan should fail check</h6>
<p>A USS shouldn't go ahead and plan if it doesn't have accurate information.
As per SCD0035 a USS needs to verify a particular conflict status.
If flight intent data shared for a nearby flight shared is invalid, the USS can't successfully perform that verification.
It couldn't have obtained valid information about the other operational intents it's supposed to verify that conflict status against.
Therefore, the USS should fail an attempt to plan. If the plan succeeds, we know they've violated SCD0035 because they failed to verify that particular conflict status.</p>

<p>The test driver instructs tested_uss to plan flight 1. tested_uss should (per SCD0035) check if any conflicts with flight 2
which is of equal priority and came first.
The planning attempt should fail because tested_uss will be unable to obtain valid operational intent details for flight 2.</p>

However, this duration is from time start - Receipt of subscription notification from DSS, which does not exist for this check.
In this check we use time start when the test driver asked the USS to plan the failed flight.
When checking notification not sent, we should wait for the same duration that is used for when checking notification sent.

<h2>[46] Data Validation of GET operational intents by USS</h2>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>This test checks that the USS being tested validates the operational intents received as response to its GET request from another USS.
mock_uss plans an operation designed to be relevant to (but not intersect) the operation tested_uss will plan, and provides the data that tested_uss GETs.
tested_uss validates the GET response from mock_uss and accordingly plan its operation.</p>
<p>The primary requirement tested by this scenario is <strong><a href="https://github.com/interuss/monitoring/blob/46ab3ae9c3a91e411d4b3fb5835e269491f0a0ed/monitoring/uss_qualifier/requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md">astm.f3548.v21.SCD0035</a></strong> because a USS cannot verify its operational intent does not conflict when it cannot obtain valid details for that operational intent.</p>
<p>This scenario assumes that the area used in the scenario is already clear of any pre-existing flights (using, for instance, PrepareFlightPlanners scenario).</p>
<h3>Resources</h3>
<h4>flight_intents</h4>
<p>FlightIntentsResource provides the two flight intents which must be relevant to each other, but must not intersect.
This can generally be accomplished when the convex hulls of the 2D footprints of the two flights intersect, but the polygons do not intersect.
There is an overlap in time and altitude of the two flights.</p>

USS about its operational intent to the subscribing USS in no more than MaxRespondToSubscriptionNotification (5) seconds,
95 percent of the time.
To verify that notification was indeed sent for this check, waiting up to MaxRespondToSubscriptionNotificationSeconds gets us
95 percent confidence in declaring the USS non-compliant if notification is not received.
To ensure the notifications sent are not missed for a test case, we can pick a threshold that gives
a very high (e.g., 99 percent per test) confidence of non-compliance. We can make conservative assumptions
about the distribution of the delays. If we assume that the notification delays have a normal distribution
with 95 percentile at 5 seconds, then with the standard deviation of 3.04, we get the 99 percentile at 7.07 seconds.
Hence, for test cases that check notification sent for an operational intent, we will wait for notifications till threshold
<a href="https://github.com/interuss/monitoring/blob/46ab3ae9c3a91e411d4b3fb5835e269491f0a0ed/monitoring/uss_qualifier/scenarios/astm/utm/data_exchange_validation/test_steps/wait.py">MaxTimeToWaitForSubscriptionNotificationSeconds</a>  (rounding to 7 seconds).</p>
<h6>Note</h6>
<p>As per <strong><a href="https://github.com/interuss/monitoring/blob/46ab3ae9c3a91e411d4b3fb5835e269491f0a0ed/monitoring/uss_qualifier/requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md">astm.f3548.v21.SCD0085</a></strong>, MaxRespondToSubscriptionNotification
is measured from time_start - Receipt of subscription notification from DSS -
till time_end - Entity details sent to subscribing USS.
To make sure the test driver gives enough time for notifications to be received by mock_uss,
it marks the time to get interactions from mock_uss as - the time test driver initiates the plan.
The sequence of events is -</p>
<ol>
<li>Test driver initiates plan to tested_uss. t0</li>
<li>tested_uss shares the plan with DSS and receives DSS response. t_time_start.</li>
<li>tested_uss responds to test driver with Completed.</li>
<li>Test driver checks for shared operational_intent in DSS and checks its retrievable. t1</li>
<li>Test driver waits for MaxTimeToWaitForSubscriptionNotificationSeconds.</li>
<li>Test driver retrieves interactions from mock_uss. t1 + MaxTimeToWaitForSubscriptionNotificationSeconds</li>
<li>Test driver should find the notification in these interactions to declare that USS sent notifications.</li>
</ol>
<p>We know from above that waiting from t_time_start for MaxTimeToWaitForSubscriptionNotificationSeconds would
give us 99% confidence that we receive the notifications. But, test_driver doesn't have access to t_time_start.
So, it starts waiting from a point of time after the t_time_start that is t1.
This ensures that test driver waits for a long enough duration before getting the interactions. Hence, we get
a high confidence that the test driver correctly verifies if a notification was sent by tested_uss.</p>

<p>This page describes the content of a common test case where a valid user flight intent fails in a flight planner, because of invalid data shared for a nearby flight shared by another USS.  See <code>plan_flight_intent_expect_failed</code> in invalid_op_test_steps.py.</p>
<h6>🛑 Plan should fail check</h6>
<p>A USS shouldn't go ahead and plan if it doesn't have accurate information.
As per SCD0035 a USS needs to verify a particular conflict status.
If flight intent data shared for a nearby flight shared is invalid, the USS can't successfully perform that verification.
It couldn't have obtained valid information about the other operational intents it's supposed to verify that conflict status against.
Therefore, the USS should fail an attempt to plan. If the plan succeeds, we know they've violated SCD0035 because they failed to verify that particular conflict status.</p>

<h2>[47] Awareness of relevant operational intents</h2>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>When a USS submits an operational intent to DSS, a subscription is associated with that operational intent in DSS.
This subscription can be either an implicit or explicit subscription that covers the area of the operational intent.
The subscription helps the USS to be notified of new or modified operations in the area, when its operational intent is in
Activated, NonConforming and Contingent states. In this scenario, we will verify that USS under test has a subscription
to cover the operational intent area, and receives relevant notifications from other USSes.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/interuss/monitoring/blob/46ab3ae9c3a91e411d4b3fb5835e269491f0a0ed/monitoring/uss_qualifier/requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md">astm.f3548.v21.SCD0080</a></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This scenario assumes that the area used in the scenario is already clear of any pre-existing flights (using, for instance, PrepareFlightPlanners scenario).</p>

<p>To reach a situation where Flight 1 and Flight 2 do not intersect but are relevant to each other:</p>
<ul>
<li>their time ranges and altitudes do intersect;</li>
<li>their geometries do not intersect, but their convex hulls do.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because the scenario involves activation of intents, all activated intents must be active during the execution of the test scenario. Additionally, their end time must leave sufficient time for the execution of the test scenario. For the sake of simplicity, it is recommended to set the start and end times of all the intents to the same range.</p>

<h2>[48] Awareness of relevant operational intents</h2>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>When a USS submits an operational intent to DSS, a subscription is associated with that operational intent in DSS.
This subscription can be either an implicit or explicit subscription that covers the area of the operational intent.
The subscription helps the USS to be notified of new or modified operations in the area, when its operational intent is in
Activated, NonConforming and Contingent states. In this scenario, we will verify that USS under test has a subscription
to cover the operational intent area, and receives relevant notifications from other USSes.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/interuss/monitoring/blob/46ab3ae9c3a91e411d4b3fb5835e269491f0a0ed/monitoring/uss_qualifier/requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md">astm.f3548.v21.SCD0080</a></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This scenario assumes that the area used in the scenario is already clear of any pre-existing flights (using, for instance, PrepareFlightPlanners scenario).</p>

        <th>Must be relevant, but not intersecting</th>

<p>To reach a situation where Flight 1 and Flight 2 do not intersect but are relevant to each other:</p>
<ul>
<li>their time ranges and altitudes do intersect;</li>
<li>their geometries do not intersect, but their convex hulls do.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because the scenario involves activation of intents, all activated intents must be active during the execution of the test scenario. Additionally, their end time must leave sufficient time for the execution of the test scenario. For the sake of simplicity, it is recommended to set the start and end times of all the intents to the same range.</p>

<h4>Clear area validation test step</h4>
<p>uss_qualifier verifies with the DSS that there are no operational intents remaining in the area.</p>
<h5>🛑 DSS responses check</h5>
<p>If the DSS fails to reply to a query concerning operational intent references in a given area, or fails to allow the deletion of
an operational intent from its own creator, it is in violation of <strong><a href="https://github.com/interuss/monitoring/blob/46ab3ae9c3a91e411d4b3fb5835e269491f0a0ed/monitoring/uss_qualifier/requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md">astm.f3548.v21.DSS0005,1</a></strong>

<h5>🛑 Area is clear of op intents check</h5>
<p>If operational intents exist in the 4D area(s) that should be clear, then the current state of the test environment is not suitable to conduct tests so this check will fail.</p>
<p>This step examines whether any operational intents remain.  If any foreign (other than uss_qualifier-owned) operational intents remain, then this step's checks will fail.  If any uss_qualifier-owned operational intents remain, the checks for this step do not fail but instead we proceed to the next test case.  If the area is clear, we skip the next test case.</p>

<h2>[50] ASTM F3548-21 evaluate system versions</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>ASTM F3548-21 GEN0305 requires that the USS's test system (provided per GEN0300) uses the currently deployed software version except when testing an update.  This scenario checks the test and production versions of all participants' systems and ensures that no more than one participant's test system (presumably the participant who is testing an update) has a different version than their production system.</p>
<h3>Resources</h3>
<h4>test_env_version_providers</h4>

<h4>Evaluate current system versions test step</h4>
<h5>⚠️ At most one participant is testing a new software version check</h5>
<p>Per GEN0305, a participant may temporarily have a different software version in the test environment than in production in order to test that new software version.  But, as the purpose of testing is to ensure continued compliance and interoperation with other participants' systems that have already been demonstrated functional, if two or more participants have differing software versions between the test and production environments, at least one of these participants will have failed to meet <strong><a href="https://github.com/interuss/monitoring/blob/46ab3ae9c3a91e411d4b3fb5835e269491f0a0ed/monitoring/uss_qualifier/requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md">astm.f3548.v21.GEN0305</a></strong>.</p>

<h4>Evaluate system version consistency test step</h4>
<h5>⚠️ Software versions are consistent throughout test run check</h5>

<h3>Performance of SCD requests to USS test case</h3>
<h4>Performance of successful operational intent details requests test step</h4>
<p>In this step, all successful requests for operational intent details made to the USSs that are part of the flight
