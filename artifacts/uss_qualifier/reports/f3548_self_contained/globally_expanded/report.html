<h2>11. [S8] ASTM F3548-21 UTM DSS Operational Intent Reference State Transitions</h2>
<h3>11.1. Overview</h3>
<p>This scenario ensures that a DSS will only let the owner of an operational intent reference modify it.</p>
<h3>11.2. Resources</h3>
<h4>11.2.1. flight_intents</h4>
<p>A <code>resources.flight_planning.FlightIntentsResource</code> containing the flight intents to be used in this scenario:</p>
<p>This scenario expects to find at least one flight intent in this resource. It will use its extents to create and mutate an operational intent reference,
but ignore any specified states, as this scenario will iterate over all allowed states.</p>
<p>✅ Provided by non_conflicting_flights in top-level resource pool.</p>
<h4>11.2.2. dss</h4>
<p>A <code>resources.astm.f3548.v21.DSSInstanceResource</code> pointing to the DSS instance to test for this scenario.</p>
<p>✅ Provided by instance 1 in dss_instances in top-level resource pool.</p>
<h4>11.2.3. id_generator</h4>
<p>A <code>resources.interuss.IDGeneratorResource</code> that will be used to generate the IDs of the operational intent references created in this scenario.</p>
<p>✅ Provided by id_generator in top-level resource pool.</p>

<p>Note that to benefit from the maximum coverage, the DSS' AuthAdapterResource must be able to obtain credentials
for multiple scopes (so that a wrong scope may be used in place of the correct one) as well as an empty scope
(that is, provide credentials where the scope is an empty string).</p>
<p>This scenario will check for the scope's availability and transparently ignore checks that can't be conducted.</p>
<p>At least one of the following scopes needs to be available for this scenario to at least partially run:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>utm.strategic_coordination</code></li>
<li><code>utm.availability_arbitration</code></li>
<li><code>utm.constraint_management</code></li>

<h2>19. [S16] ASTM F3548-21 UTM DSS Operational Intent Reference Access Control</h2>
<h3>19.1. Overview</h3>
<p>This scenario ensures that a DSS will only let the owner of an operational intent reference modify it.</p>
<h3>19.2. Resources</h3>
<h4>19.2.1. flight_intents</h4>
<p>A <code>resources.flight_planning.FlightIntentsResource</code> containing the flight intents to be used in this scenario:</p>
<p>This scenario expects to find at least two separate flight intents in this resource, as it will use their extent
to create two operational intents references.</p>
<p>✅ Provided by non_conflicting_flights in top-level resource pool.</p>
<h4>19.2.2. dss</h4>
<p>A <code>resources.astm.f3548.v21.DSSInstanceResource</code> pointing to the DSS instance to test for this scenario.</p>
<p>✅ Provided by instance 1 in dss_instances in top-level resource pool.</p>
<h4>19.2.3. second_utm_auth</h4>
<p>A <code>resources.communications.AuthAdapterResource</code> containing a second set of valid credentials for interacting with the DSS.</p>
<p>This second set of credentials is required to validate that the DSS is properly enforcing access control rules, and properly limits the actions of a client against
the resources exposed by the DSS.</p>
<p>The participant under test is responsible for providing this second set of credentials along the primary ones used in most other scenarios.</p>
<h5>19.2.3.1. Credential requirements</h5>
<p>In general, these test credentials may be in all points equal to the ones used by the <code>AuthAdapterResource</code> that is
provided to the <code>dss</code> resources above, except for the value contained in the <code>sub</code> claim of the token.</p>
<p>For the purpose of this scenario, these credentials must be allowed to create, modify and delete operational intents on the DSS,
as well as querying operational intent references.</p>
<h6>19.2.3.1.1. Required scope</h6>
<p>For the purpose of this scenario, the <code>second_utm_auth</code> resource must provide access to a token with at least the following scope:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>utm.strategic_coordination</code></li>
</ul>
<h6>19.2.3.1.2. Separate subscription</h6>
<p>Note that the subscription (or 'sub' claim) of the token that will be obtained for this resource
MUST be different from the one of the <code>dss</code> resources mentioned above:
this will be verified at runtime, and this scenario will fail if the second set of credentials belong to the same subscription as the main one.</p>
<p>✅ Provided by second_utm_auth in top-level resource pool.</p>
<h4>19.2.4. id_generator</h4>
<p>A <code>resources.interuss.IDGeneratorResource</code> that will be used to generate the IDs of the operational intent references created in this scenario.</p>
<p>✅ Provided by id_generator in top-level resource pool.</p>
<h3>19.3. Setup test case</h3>
<p>Makes sure that the DSS is in a clean and expected state before running the test, and that the passed resources work as required.</p>
<p>The setup will create two separate operational intent references: one for each set of the available credentials.</p>

<h2>29. [S25] ASTM SCD DSS: USS Availability Synchronization</h2>
<h3>29.1. Overview</h3>
<p>Verifies that all CRUD operations for USS availabilities on a given DSS instance
are properly propagated to every other DSS instance participating in the deployment.</p>
<h3>29.2. Resources</h3>
<h4>29.2.1. dss</h4>
<p><a href="https://github.com/interuss/monitoring/blob/2d303723554c3144271954923d2b64c1bcc8956a/monitoring/uss_qualifier/resources/astm/f3548/v21/dss.py"><code>DSSInstanceResource</code></a> the DSS instance through which USS availabilities are created, modified and deleted.</p>

for which availabilities will be updated.</p>
<p>✅ Provided by utm_client_identity in top-level resource pool.</p>
<h3>29.3. Setup test case</h3>
<p>For the setup of this test case, the scenario ensures that the availability for the USS specified in the <code>client_identity</code> resource
is <code>Unknown</code>, which is the default expected state when nothing else is known.</p>
<h4>29.3.1. Ensure test USS has Unknown availability test step</h4>
<p>This step ensures that the scenario starts from a state where the USS availability is <code>Unknown</code>.</p>

<h2>38. [S34] ASTM F3548-21 UTM DSS Operational Intent Reference Access Control</h2>
<h3>38.1. Overview</h3>
<p>This scenario ensures that a DSS will only let the owner of an operational intent reference modify it.</p>
<h3>38.2. Resources</h3>
<h4>38.2.1. flight_intents</h4>
<p>A <code>resources.flight_planning.FlightIntentsResource</code> containing the flight intents to be used in this scenario:</p>
<p>This scenario expects to find at least two separate flight intents in this resource, as it will use their extent
to create two operational intents references.</p>
<p>✅ Provided by non_conflicting_flights in top-level resource pool.</p>
<h4>38.2.2. dss</h4>
<p>A <code>resources.astm.f3548.v21.DSSInstanceResource</code> pointing to the DSS instance to test for this scenario.</p>
<p>✅ Provided by instance 2 in dss_instances in top-level resource pool.</p>
<h4>38.2.3. second_utm_auth</h4>
<p>A <code>resources.communications.AuthAdapterResource</code> containing a second set of valid credentials for interacting with the DSS.</p>
<p>This second set of credentials is required to validate that the DSS is properly enforcing access control rules, and properly limits the actions of a client against
the resources exposed by the DSS.</p>
<p>The participant under test is responsible for providing this second set of credentials along the primary ones used in most other scenarios.</p>
<h5>38.2.3.1. Credential requirements</h5>
<p>In general, these test credentials may be in all points equal to the ones used by the <code>AuthAdapterResource</code> that is
provided to the <code>dss</code> resources above, except for the value contained in the <code>sub</code> claim of the token.</p>
<p>For the purpose of this scenario, these credentials must be allowed to create, modify and delete operational intents on the DSS,
as well as querying operational intent references.</p>
<h6>38.2.3.1.1. Required scope</h6>
<p>For the purpose of this scenario, the <code>second_utm_auth</code> resource must provide access to a token with at least the following scope:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>utm.strategic_coordination</code></li>
</ul>
<h6>38.2.3.1.2. Separate subscription</h6>
<p>Note that the subscription (or 'sub' claim) of the token that will be obtained for this resource
MUST be different from the one of the <code>dss</code> resources mentioned above:
this will be verified at runtime, and this scenario will fail if the second set of credentials belong to the same subscription as the main one.</p>
<p>✅ Provided by second_utm_auth in top-level resource pool.</p>
<h4>38.2.4. id_generator</h4>
<p>A <code>resources.interuss.IDGeneratorResource</code> that will be used to generate the IDs of the operational intent references created in this scenario.</p>
<p>✅ Provided by id_generator in top-level resource pool.</p>
<h3>38.3. Setup test case</h3>
<p>Makes sure that the DSS is in a clean and expected state before running the test, and that the passed resources work as required.</p>
<p>The setup will create two separate operational intent references: one for each set of the available credentials.</p>

<h3>44.1. Description</h3>
<p>This scenario performs a simple flight planning sequence with a single USS and no interactions with other USSs.  It
verifies that basic planning functionality for the USS works properly.</p>
<p>It assumes that the area used in the scenario is already clear of any pre-existing flights (using, for instance,
PrepareFlightPlanners scenario).</p>
<h3>44.2. Resources</h3>
<h4>44.2.1. flight_intents</h4>
<p>The FlightIntentsResource must provide the following flight intents:</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Flight intent ID</th>
    <th>Flight name</th>
    <th>Priority</th>
    <th>Airspace usage state</th>
    <th>UAS state</th>
  </tr>

    <td rowspan="2">Nominal</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>flight1_activated</code></td>

As such, if the USS synchronizes its time correctly, the attempt should be rejected.</p>
<h5>46.3.2.1. 🛑 Incorrectly planned check</h5>
<p>If the USS successfully plans the flight or otherwise fails to indicate a rejection, it means that it failed to validate
that the intent provided was in the past. Therefore, this check will fail if the USS indicates success in creating the
flight from the user flight intent, per one of the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>the USS does not implement properly the interface <em>getOperationalIntentDetails</em> as required by <strong><a href="https://github.com/interuss/monitoring/blob/2d303723554c3144271954923d2b64c1bcc8956a/monitoring/uss_qualifier/requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md">astm.f3548.v21.USS0105</a></strong>, which specifies that <em>The end time may not be in the past</em>; or</li>

<p>Because the scenario involves activation of intents, all activated intents must be active during the execution of the
test scenario. Additionally, their end time must leave sufficient time for the execution of the test scenario. For the
sake of simplicity, it is recommended to set the start and end times of all the intents to the same range.</p>

<p>If operational intents exist in the 4D area(s) that should be clear, then the current state of the test environment is not suitable to conduct tests so this check will fail.</p>
<p>While this scenario assumes that the area used is already clear of any pre-existing flights (using, for instance, PrepareFlightPlanners scenario) in order to avoid a large number of area-clearing operations, the scenario will not proceed correctly if the area was left in a dirty state following a previous scenario that was supposed to leave the area clear.

<p>If operational intents exist in the 4D area(s) that should be clear, then the current state of the test environment is not suitable to conduct tests so this check will fail.</p>
<p>While this scenario assumes that the area used is already clear of any pre-existing flights (using, for instance, PrepareFlightPlanners scenario) in order to avoid a large number of area-clearing operations, the scenario will not proceed correctly if the area was left in a dirty state following a previous scenario that was supposed to leave the area clear.

<p>If operational intents exist in the 4D area(s) that should be clear, then the current state of the test environment is not suitable to conduct tests so this check will fail.</p>
<p>While this scenario assumes that the area used is already clear of any pre-existing flights (using, for instance, PrepareFlightPlanners scenario) in order to avoid a large number of area-clearing operations, the scenario will not proceed correctly if the area was left in a dirty state following a previous scenario that was supposed to leave the area clear.

<h2>53. [S47] Data Validation of GET operational intents by USS</h2>
<h3>53.1. Description</h3>
<p>This test checks that the USS being tested validates the operational intents received as response to its GET request from another USS.
mock_uss plans an operation designed to be relevant to (but not intersect) the operation tested_uss will plan, and provides the data that tested_uss GETs.
tested_uss validates the GET response from mock_uss and accordingly plan its operation.</p>
<p>The primary requirement tested by this scenario is <strong><a href="https://github.com/interuss/monitoring/blob/2d303723554c3144271954923d2b64c1bcc8956a/monitoring/uss_qualifier/requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md">astm.f3548.v21.SCD0035</a></strong> because a USS cannot verify its operational intent does not conflict when it cannot obtain valid details for that operational intent.</p>
<p>This scenario assumes that the area used in the scenario is already clear of any pre-existing flights (using, for instance, PrepareFlightPlanners scenario).</p>
<h3>53.2. Resources</h3>
<h4>53.2.1. flight_intents</h4>
<p>FlightIntentsResource provides the two flight intents which must be relevant to each other, but must not intersect.
This can generally be accomplished when the convex hulls of the 2D footprints of the two flights intersect, but the polygons do not intersect.
There is an overlap in time and altitude of the two flights.</p>
<ul>
<li>flight_1</li>
<li>flight_2</li>
</ul>
<p>✅ Provided by non_conflicting_flights in top-level resource pool.</p>
<h4>53.2.2. mock_uss</h4>
<p>MockUSSResource that will be used for planning flights, controlling data shared for validation testing, and gathering interuss interactions from mock_uss.</p>
<p>✅ Provided by mock_uss in top-level resource pool.</p>
<h4>53.2.3. tested_uss</h4>
<p>FlightPlannerResource that will be used for the USS being tested for its data validation of operational intent.</p>
<p>✅ Provided by instance 1 in flight_planners in top-level resource pool.</p>
<h4>53.2.4. dss</h4>
<p>DSSInstanceResource that provides access to a DSS instance where flight creation/sharing can be verified.</p>

USS about its operational intent to the subscribing USS in no more than MaxRespondToSubscriptionNotification (5) seconds,
95 percent of the time.
To verify that notification was indeed sent for this check, waiting up to MaxRespondToSubscriptionNotificationSeconds gets us
95 percent confidence in declaring the USS non-compliant if notification is not received.
To ensure the notifications sent are not missed for a test case, we can pick a threshold that gives
a very high (e.g., 99 percent per test) confidence of non-compliance. We can make conservative assumptions
about the distribution of the delays. If we assume that the notification delays have a normal distribution
with 95 percentile at 5 seconds, then with the standard deviation of 3.04, we get the 99 percentile at 7.07 seconds.
Hence, for test cases that check notification sent for an operational intent, we will wait for notifications till threshold

is measured from time_start - Receipt of subscription notification from DSS -
till time_end - Entity details sent to subscribing USS.
To make sure the test driver gives enough time for notifications to be received by mock_uss,
it marks the time to get interactions from mock_uss as - the time test driver initiates the plan.
The sequence of events is -</p>
<ol>
<li>Test driver initiates plan to tested_uss. t0</li>
<li>tested_uss shares the plan with DSS and receives DSS response. t_time_start.</li>
<li>tested_uss responds to test driver with Completed.</li>
<li>Test driver checks for shared operational_intent in DSS and checks its retrievable. t1</li>
<li>Test driver waits for MaxTimeToWaitForSubscriptionNotificationSeconds.</li>
<li>Test driver retrieves interactions from mock_uss. t1 + MaxTimeToWaitForSubscriptionNotificationSeconds</li>
<li>Test driver should find the notification in these interactions to declare that USS sent notifications.</li>
</ol>
<p>We know from above that waiting from t_time_start for MaxTimeToWaitForSubscriptionNotificationSeconds would
give us 99% confidence that we receive the notifications. But, test_driver doesn't have access to t_time_start.
So, it starts waiting from a point of time after the t_time_start that is t1.
This ensures that test driver waits for a long enough duration before getting the interactions. Hence, we get
a high confidence that the test driver correctly verifies if a notification was sent by tested_uss.</p>

<h2>54. [S48] Data Validation of GET operational intents by USS</h2>
<h3>54.1. Description</h3>
<p>This test checks that the USS being tested validates the operational intents received as response to its GET request from another USS.
mock_uss plans an operation designed to be relevant to (but not intersect) the operation tested_uss will plan, and provides the data that tested_uss GETs.
tested_uss validates the GET response from mock_uss and accordingly plan its operation.</p>
<p>The primary requirement tested by this scenario is <strong><a href="https://github.com/interuss/monitoring/blob/2d303723554c3144271954923d2b64c1bcc8956a/monitoring/uss_qualifier/requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md">astm.f3548.v21.SCD0035</a></strong> because a USS cannot verify its operational intent does not conflict when it cannot obtain valid details for that operational intent.</p>
<p>This scenario assumes that the area used in the scenario is already clear of any pre-existing flights (using, for instance, PrepareFlightPlanners scenario).</p>
<h3>54.2. Resources</h3>
<h4>54.2.1. flight_intents</h4>
<p>FlightIntentsResource provides the two flight intents which must be relevant to each other, but must not intersect.
This can generally be accomplished when the convex hulls of the 2D footprints of the two flights intersect, but the polygons do not intersect.
There is an overlap in time and altitude of the two flights.</p>

USS about its operational intent to the subscribing USS in no more than MaxRespondToSubscriptionNotification (5) seconds,
95 percent of the time.
To verify that notification was indeed sent for this check, waiting up to MaxRespondToSubscriptionNotificationSeconds gets us
95 percent confidence in declaring the USS non-compliant if notification is not received.
To ensure the notifications sent are not missed for a test case, we can pick a threshold that gives
a very high (e.g., 99 percent per test) confidence of non-compliance. We can make conservative assumptions
about the distribution of the delays. If we assume that the notification delays have a normal distribution
with 95 percentile at 5 seconds, then with the standard deviation of 3.04, we get the 99 percentile at 7.07 seconds.
Hence, for test cases that check notification sent for an operational intent, we will wait for notifications till threshold
<a href="https://github.com/interuss/monitoring/blob/2d303723554c3144271954923d2b64c1bcc8956a/monitoring/uss_qualifier/scenarios/astm/utm/data_exchange_validation/test_steps/wait.py">MaxTimeToWaitForSubscriptionNotificationSeconds</a>  (rounding to 7 seconds).</p>

<p>As per <strong><a href="https://github.com/interuss/monitoring/blob/2d303723554c3144271954923d2b64c1bcc8956a/monitoring/uss_qualifier/requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md">astm.f3548.v21.SCD0085</a></strong>, MaxRespondToSubscriptionNotification
is measured from time_start - Receipt of subscription notification from DSS -
till time_end - Entity details sent to subscribing USS.
To make sure the test driver gives enough time for notifications to be received by mock_uss,
it marks the time to get interactions from mock_uss as - the time test driver initiates the plan.
The sequence of events is -</p>
<ol>
<li>Test driver initiates plan to tested_uss. t0</li>
<li>tested_uss shares the plan with DSS and receives DSS response. t_time_start.</li>
<li>tested_uss responds to test driver with Completed.</li>
<li>Test driver checks for shared operational_intent in DSS and checks its retrievable. t1</li>
<li>Test driver waits for MaxTimeToWaitForSubscriptionNotificationSeconds.</li>
<li>Test driver retrieves interactions from mock_uss. t1 + MaxTimeToWaitForSubscriptionNotificationSeconds</li>
<li>Test driver should find the notification in these interactions to declare that USS sent notifications.</li>
</ol>
<p>We know from above that waiting from t_time_start for MaxTimeToWaitForSubscriptionNotificationSeconds would
give us 99% confidence that we receive the notifications. But, test_driver doesn't have access to t_time_start.
So, it starts waiting from a point of time after the t_time_start that is t1.
This ensures that test driver waits for a long enough duration before getting the interactions. Hence, we get
a high confidence that the test driver correctly verifies if a notification was sent by tested_uss.</p>

<p>As per the above requirement, the notification should not be sent by a USS about an entity that could not be created in DSS
to any USS. To verify that notification was indeed not sent, we need to wait and check up to a threshold to get confidence
that USS did not send notification.
The max duration for sending a notification in <a href="https://github.com/interuss/monitoring/blob/2d303723554c3144271954923d2b64c1bcc8956a/monitoring/uss_qualifier/requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md">SCD0085</a> is MaxRespondToSubscriptionNotification(5) seconds.
However, this duration is from time start - Receipt of subscription notification from DSS, which does not exist for this check.
In this check we use time start when the test driver asked the USS to plan the failed flight.
When checking notification not sent, we should wait for the same duration that is used for when checking notification sent.

<h2>55. [S49] Awareness of relevant operational intents</h2>
<h3>55.1. Description</h3>
<p>When a USS submits an operational intent to DSS, a subscription is associated with that operational intent in DSS.
This subscription can be either an implicit or explicit subscription that covers the area of the operational intent.
The subscription helps the USS to be notified of new or modified operations in the area, when its operational intent is in
Activated, NonConforming and Contingent states. In this scenario, we will verify that USS under test has a subscription
to cover the operational intent area, and receives relevant notifications from other USSes.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/interuss/monitoring/blob/2d303723554c3144271954923d2b64c1bcc8956a/monitoring/uss_qualifier/requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md">astm.f3548.v21.SCD0080</a></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This scenario assumes that the area used in the scenario is already clear of any pre-existing flights (using, for instance, PrepareFlightPlanners scenario).</p>
<h3>55.2. Resources</h3>
<h4>55.2.1. flight_intents</h4>
<p>FlightIntentsResource that provides the following flight intents:</p>
<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Flight intent ID</th>
        <th>Flight name</th>
        <th>State</th><!-- TODO: Update with usage_state and uas_state when new flight planning API is adopted -->
        <th>Must be relevant, but not intersecting</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>flight_1_planned</code></td>
        <td rowspan="2">Flight 1</td>
        <td>Accepted</td>
        <td rowspan="2">Flight 2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>flight_1_activated</code></td>
        <td>Activated</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>flight_2_planned</code></td>
        <td rowspan="2">Flight 2</td>
        <td rowspan="2">Accepted</td>
        <td rowspan="2">Flight 1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>flight_2_planned_modified</code></td>
    </tr>
</table>
<p>To reach a situation where Flight 1 and Flight 2 do not intersect but are relevant to each other:</p>
<ul>
<li>their time ranges and altitudes do intersect;</li>
<li>their geometries do not intersect, but their convex hulls do.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because the scenario involves activation of intents, all activated intents must be active during the execution of the test scenario. Additionally, their end time must leave sufficient time for the execution of the test scenario. For the sake of simplicity, it is recommended to set the start and end times of all the intents to the same range.</p>

<h2>56. [S50] Awareness of relevant operational intents</h2>
<h3>56.1. Description</h3>
<p>When a USS submits an operational intent to DSS, a subscription is associated with that operational intent in DSS.
This subscription can be either an implicit or explicit subscription that covers the area of the operational intent.
The subscription helps the USS to be notified of new or modified operations in the area, when its operational intent is in
Activated, NonConforming and Contingent states. In this scenario, we will verify that USS under test has a subscription
to cover the operational intent area, and receives relevant notifications from other USSes.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/interuss/monitoring/blob/2d303723554c3144271954923d2b64c1bcc8956a/monitoring/uss_qualifier/requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md">astm.f3548.v21.SCD0080</a></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This scenario assumes that the area used in the scenario is already clear of any pre-existing flights (using, for instance, PrepareFlightPlanners scenario).</p>
<h3>56.2. Resources</h3>
<h4>56.2.1. flight_intents</h4>
<p>FlightIntentsResource that provides the following flight intents:</p>
<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Flight intent ID</th>
        <th>Flight name</th>
        <th>State</th><!-- TODO: Update with usage_state and uas_state when new flight planning API is adopted -->
        <th>Must be relevant, but not intersecting</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>flight_1_planned</code></td>
        <td rowspan="2">Flight 1</td>
        <td>Accepted</td>
        <td rowspan="2">Flight 2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>flight_1_activated</code></td>
        <td>Activated</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>flight_2_planned</code></td>
        <td rowspan="2">Flight 2</td>
        <td rowspan="2">Accepted</td>
        <td rowspan="2">Flight 1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>flight_2_planned_modified</code></td>
    </tr>
</table>
<p>To reach a situation where Flight 1 and Flight 2 do not intersect but are relevant to each other:</p>
<ul>
<li>their time ranges and altitudes do intersect;</li>
<li>their geometries do not intersect, but their convex hulls do.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because the scenario involves activation of intents, all activated intents must be active during the execution of the test scenario. Additionally, their end time must leave sufficient time for the execution of the test scenario. For the sake of simplicity, it is recommended to set the start and end times of all the intents to the same range.</p>
